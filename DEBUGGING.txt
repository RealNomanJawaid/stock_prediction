We've successfully debugged the code. We've identified a logging message
generated by TensorFlow regarding the configuration of oneDNN custom operations.
The message indicates that these operations are enabled, which may result in slightly 
different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different
computation orders. 

Additionally, the message provides guidance on how to 
disable these optimizations if you prefer more consistent numerical results across
different runs.
